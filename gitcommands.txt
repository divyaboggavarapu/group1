Basic Git commands---

1.Check who changed the file:
$ git blame filename

2. With --rebase , it runs git rebase instead of git merge
$ git pull --rebase

git fetch [remotename]
If you do fetch you'll need to merge any changes into your local branches. If you're on a branch that's tracking a remote branch on Github, then

git pull
will first do a fetch, and then merge in the tracked branch
